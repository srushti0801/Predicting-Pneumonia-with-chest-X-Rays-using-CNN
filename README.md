# Predicting-Pneumonia-with-chest-X-Rays-using-CNN
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based project to detect Pneumonia from chest X-ray images.
The model is built in TensorFlow/Keras and deployed using Streamlit for easy interaction.

# Libraries & Frameworks
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)

# Development Tools
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit for Deployment

# Dataset Used
- Dataset Source: Kaggle - Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)
- Classes: Normal and Pneumonia
- Type: X-ray images
- Format: JPEG/PNG images

# How to Run the Project
- 1. Clone the Repository
- git clone [https://github.com/srushti0801/Pneumonia-Detection-CNN](https://github.com/srushti0801/Predicting-Pneumonia-with-chest-X-Rays-using-CNN).git
  cd Pneumonia-Detection-CNN

- 2. Install Dependencies
- pip install -r requirements.txt

- 3. Run Streamlit Web Application
- streamlit run "StreamLit Deployment Pneumonia.py"

- 4. Using the Web App
-Upload a chest X-ray image in JPEG, PNG format.
-The app will predict if the X-ray shows signs of Pneumonia or is Normal with a simple output.
